# Picture-Typer
Originally created by Barb Ericson, but modified to convert any image into ASCII Art fit for a word document.

Compile and run the following file:
Picture-Typer/PicTyper/classes/PictureTester2.java

## New version
This was one of my first programs and has since been replaced with a new repository at https://github.com/XanderGardner/pictext
